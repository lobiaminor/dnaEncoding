# Organization

1.	main.py: executable code handling wavelet transformation andStack-Run (encoding and decoding) on target input images
2.	settings.ini containing the parameters to be used in the main program
3.	img: folder containing the set of test images
4.	results: folder containing the results of the Stack-Run coding in text files
5.	haar.py, cdf.py, files containing respectively the code for waveletencoding/decoding using Haar or CDF 9/7 (integer to integer)
6.	stackrun.py: file containing the code for encoding decoding of a given signal usingthe Stack-Run algorithm
7.	miscellaneous: folder containing various scripts used for the evaluation of the strategies we tested
8.	dna_coding_docs: folder containing various documentation, including the complete report for this project (report.pdf)

For a detailed explanation of the scope of the project, the techniques used, the result and a description of the code including all the input/output parameters, please refer to dna_coding_docs/report.pdf.
The source code for this project is commented in all its parts, we encourage the readers to take a look at it, it is easier than one could imagine.
