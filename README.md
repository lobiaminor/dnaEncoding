# Questions

1. We encode 2D images as if they were long 1D sequences, so: how to decode? 
Our idea right now is to send a small header -two stacks- indicating the dimensions of the image. Then, the decoder can reconstruct the image because it knows its shape.

# To-do list

Jose
- Wrap the decoder in a cool class

Both
- Start with the report (it will be awesome)
